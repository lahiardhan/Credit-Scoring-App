# Credit Scoring App

Finance Merdeka is an emerging technology company specializing in finance. It provides various technology-based financial solutions to empower individuals and businesses. Despite providing various technology-based financial solutions, there are several stages in the service that are carried out manually. One such stage is the credit risk check when individuals and businesses apply for loans. This is done entirely manually by the Risk Analytics Analyst team. This stage certainly takes a lot of time and is very inefficient. Therefore, Finance Merdeka seeks to optimize this stage.

This project is carried out with the aim of utilizing the data to optimize the credit risk examination process when a loan application takes place by developing a machine learning-based system to predict and optimize the credit risk examination process when a loan application takes place. Based on the data owned, the expected output target is to group customers who apply for loans into three categories, namely Good, Standard, and Poor.

In the development process, we will experiment with various machine learning approaches or algorithms and compare them to obtain the best performing model.
